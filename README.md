# Construction_Calculator
GUI made in Python/Tkinter to automate some of the floor tiling work I do everyday.

Images below showcase the program. In the first image is the GUI and a bit of sample information to be entered into the blank fields. The second image showcases the text file that is created upon clicking "submit". It currently creates a file named "NewBid" on the desktop and calculates how many boxes of tile you will need according to the square footages of tile that you enter into the blank fields and prints them to the new file for your record.
